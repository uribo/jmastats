  block_no,
  year,
  month,
  day,
  cache = TRUE,
  pack = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{item}{Type of weather data to be acquired. Mainly specifies
the interval between records (e.g. \code{daily} or \code{hourly}).
See NOTE for details.}

\item{block_no}{Block number of the location to be observed. It is assumed that
block_no is input as a string consisting of a 4- or 5-digit number. If a
numeric value is specified, it is processed as a string.}

\item{year}{select year}

\item{month}{select month}

\item{day}{select date (default \code{NULL})}

\item{cache}{use cash and save to cache.  (\code{TRUE}, the default)}

\item{pack}{Whether to packing common variables or not.  (\code{TRUE}, the default)}

\item{quiet}{Whether to output information on variable and
row combinations that were treated as missing values
for some reason. (\code{TRUE}, the default)}
}
\value{
a \code{tbl} object

Refer to the data available in the JMA Historical Weather Data Search.
Executed by specifying the target location and date.
Currently, not all types of data acquisition are supported.

\note{
The parameter \code{item} chooses one from these:
\itemize{
\item annually: Annual value. Please specify a location by \code{block_no}.
\item monthly: Monthly value. Please specify location and year.
\item 3monthly: Value every 3 months. Please specify location and year.
\item 10daily: Seasonal value. Please specify location and year.
\item mb5daily: Semi-seasonal value. Please specify location and year.
\item daily: Daily value. Please specify location, year and month.
\item hourly: Hourly value. Please specify location, year, month and day.
\item rank: Values of the largest in the history of observations.
\item nml_ym: Climatological normals for each year and month.
\item nml_3m: Climatological normals for each 3 months.
\item nml_10d: Climatological normals for each season (almost 10 days).
\item nml_mb5d: Climatological normals for each semi-season (almost 5 days).
\item nml_daily: Daily climatological normals for specific month.
for each location.
